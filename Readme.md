#### Corrupted Languages

Corrupted languages are the abyssal counterparts to other languages. They represent the corruption of the abyss reaching a culture and influencing their language. Since the abyssal corruption affects everyone differently, every culture or intelligente species' language has a corrupted counterpart. If a creature hears the corrupted version of its mother tongue, it will instantly recognize it, even if it does not speak the corrupted version of the language. The moment this happens, a level 12 spell is automatically cast without anyone involved noticing. The spell is Tongue of Corruption.
